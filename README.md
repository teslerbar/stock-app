# stock-app
```
To start using the Stock-app:

-> git clone the repository.

-> npm start

// This should install server & client dependencies, and open a new tab in the browser.
// If this doesn't work, do npm install directly from the client and server directories. 
// Then, do npm run dev from within the root folter.

Thanks.

```
